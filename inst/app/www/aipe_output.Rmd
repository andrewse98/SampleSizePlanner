In order to calculate the sample size we choose the accuracy in parameter estimation (AIPE; REF) method. We choose the expected effect size to be `r expression (delta)` = `r params$delta`, because ... The desired power was `r params$input_power` as ... Because of limits in resources the minimum sample size of interest was `r params$n_min` and the maximum sample size of interest was `r params$n_max`. The resulting confidence of the sample size estimation method was `r params$output_confidence` with the estimated sample size of `r params$output_n`.
